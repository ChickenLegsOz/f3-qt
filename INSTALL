How To Build And Install
========================

Dependencies
-----------

Before building, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* CMake (3.16 or later)
* Qt6 development packages
* C++ compiler with C++17 support
* F3 (Fight Flash Fraud) utility

For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake qt6-base-dev f3
```

For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install cmake qt6-qtbase-devel gcc-c++ f3
```

For Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S cmake qt6-base gcc f3
```

Build
-----

There are 3 ways to build from source:

1. Using CMake (Recommended):

```bash
# Create and enter a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the project
cmake ..

# Build
make

# Install (optional)
sudo make install
```

2. Using QtCreator:

   1. Download and install the latest version of QtCreator
   2. Open "CMakeLists.txt" with QtCreator
   3. Configure and build the project using QtCreator's interface

3. Using qmake (Legacy method):

```bash
qmake6
make
```

Installation
-----------

After building, you can:

1. Install system-wide (if built with CMake):
```bash
sudo make install
```

2. Run directly from the build directory:
```bash
./f3-qt
```

The program will be installed to `/usr/local/bin` by default when using `make install`.

Package Manager Installation
--------------------------

* Arch Linux:
```bash
yay -S f3-qt
```

* Other distributions:
  Check your distribution's package manager for availability

Notes
-----

* The F3 command-line utility must be installed for F3-Qt to function properly
* The installed program can be launched from the application menu or terminal
* No additional environment configuration is required
